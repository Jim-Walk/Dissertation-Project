\begin{abstract}
This dissertation examines the suitabilty of the Rust programming language, to High Performance Computing (HPC). This examination is made through porting three HPC mini apps to Rust from typical HPC languages and comparing the perfomance of the Rust and the original implementation. We also investigate the readability of Rust's higher level programming syntax for HPC programmers through the use of a questionnaire.

\chapter{Launch Scripts}\label{app:launch}

Some people include in their thesis a lot of detail, particularly
computer code, which no-one will ever read. You should be careful that
anything like this you include should contain some element of uniqueness
which justifies its inclusion.
