\begin{abstract}
This dissertation examines the suitabilty of the Rust programming language, to High Performance Computing (HPC). This examination is made through porting three HPC mini apps to Rust from typical HPC languages and comparing the perfomance of the Rust and the original implementation. We also investigate the readability of Rust's higher level programming syntax for HPC programmers through the use of a questionnaire.

\chapter{Conclusions}

This is the place to put your conclusions about your work. You can
split it into different sections if appropriate. You may want to include
a section of future work which could be carried out to continue your
research.

\appendix
% the appendix command just changes heading styles for appendices.

\chapter{Stuff which is too detailed}

Appendices should contain all the material which is considered too
detailed to be included in the main bod but which is, nevertheless,
important enough to be included in the thesis.

\chapter{Stuff which no-one will read}

Some people include in their thesis a lot of detail, particularly
computer code, which no-one will ever read. You should be careful that
anything like this you include should contain some element of uniqueness
which justifies its inclusion.
