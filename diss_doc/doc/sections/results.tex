Babel stream results show that Rayon is unable to scale as well as OpenMP\@. This is likely because of the CC-Numa layout of the system, and Rayon's affinity schedule. I might include a diagram here to show exactly what I mean. Is it worth getting the legend outside the box? would make things look neater

I might generate this figure again but without the 500MB rust run, and include chunkless para init runs instead on add, triad etc
