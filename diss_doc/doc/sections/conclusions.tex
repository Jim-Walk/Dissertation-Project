\chapter{Conclusions}
Got some cool results. The most interesting thing is that Rust is actually a pretty decent contender. Seems like it could do it with support, but there's no accounting for industry culture. Some industries/disciplines stick with the same technques for a very long time

\section{Further Work}\label{sec:furth}
It would be interesting to make another comparision between C and Rust implementations of Babel Stream, but this time with the Rust version using a static schedule similar to OpenMP's. Would also be good to do the same with k means

Taking the questionnaire further would require greater study, at greater length. Could potentially get a selection of masters students to use Rust for two weeks and see what happens.
