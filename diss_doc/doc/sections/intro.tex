\chapter{Introduction}
In the field of high performance computing, it is difficult to say what is the most popular programming language. Firstly, we must define what we mean by popularity. Do we mean how many CPU hours are spent running programs from a particular language? Or do we mean the languague in which most of the development of new high performance programs is occuring? Or even, do we mean which programming language is most well liked by HPC programmers?
The Rust programming language promises 'High-level ergonomics and low-level control' to help 'you write faster, more reliable software'~\cite{RustBook}.
