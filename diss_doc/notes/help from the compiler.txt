error[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.c` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> src/stream.rs:20:9
   |
18 |     pub fn triad(&self){
   |                  ----- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut self`
19 |         println!("entered triad!");
20 |         self.c[0] = self.a[0] + self.b[0];
   |         ^^^^^^ `self` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable

error: aborting due to previous error
