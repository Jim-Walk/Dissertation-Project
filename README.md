# Dissertation Project: High Performance Rust

This repository is a work in progress.

This repository holds all the material relavent to my High Performance Computing (HPC) Master's Dissertation Project on High Performance Rust. The purpose of this project is to investigate the usefulness of Rust in HPC, through porting some HPC mini-apps to Rust, and measuring their performance.

## Folder Structure
* initial\_research - Holds the initial work for this project, and the proposal document for the masters project.
* babel\_stream - My port of [Babel Stream](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream)
* diss\_doc - All documentation necessary for the dissertation itself.


I will complete this disseration project by late august 2019.
